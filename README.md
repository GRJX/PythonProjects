# PythonProjects

Welcome to the PythonProjects repository, a collection of random Python scripts designed to simplify various tasks. Each script is self-contained and aims to provide utility functions that enhance productivity and automation in handling specific file formats and tasks.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized into different folders for each utility. Here's what you can find in each:

- `~/CompressToZip`: Contains a script that facilitates the compression of given files and directories into a ZIP archive. A README is provided within this folder that details installation and usage instructions.
  
- `~/ConvertToHeic`: Includes a script for converting images to the HEIC format. This folder also has its own README with instructions for setup and operation.

Be sure to navigate to each folder and refer to their individual README files for more detailed guidance on how to install and use the scripts provided.
